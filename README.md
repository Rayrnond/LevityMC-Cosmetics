# I was never paid for this project.
## Let me explain.
I was hired to develop this plugin along with multiple others by a user on discord named "countdown". After successful completion of all work, all purchases made by count were chargedback under "item not received in PayPal". 

After fighting these disputes, PayPal deemed that I was in the wrong and decided to refund all of the money to count. I was never paid for the work I did, and I was left with a plugin that I had no use for.

This code is completely owned by me and was not created under any legal contract, and was not paid for. I am releasing this code to the public for free use, and I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from the use of this code.
